# Busters
**A Python based arcade game**


As an old gamer (I have been gaming for more than 30 years) it was always a dream of mine
to build one my own. As nerd ahum.. fan I love the Ghostbusters so during halloween I had some free time
To test my Python knowledge to the par I used Pygame and this is the result.

In short:
 - I wanted to build an easy and short game
 - The game needs to be build in Python to improve my skills

## UX
As this is my first try as a "game designer" I wanted something simple and pixelart based.
I did not created the art and music myself.

### Strategy
The goal of the game is endless there is no game over and the score counter is unlimited.

### Scope
For a player there is not much to not understand as the game is a space invader clone.

### Structure
The game is structured as easy as possible. Controls available are left and right arrows to move the car.
Spacebar is ude to shoot the ghosts. For every hit 1 point is given to the player.

## Technologies
 - Pygame - *Python based game engine*
 - Python - *Programming language*

### Features Left to Implement
As there is no true goal to the game a Game Over event would give a chalenge and ofcourse makes the game more interesting.

## Testing
The game has been tested happily by me.

### Deploy requirements
 - [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) *A tool to develop software*
 - [python 3](https://www.python.org/) *A programming language*
 - [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) *To get python installation packages*

### Local deployment
1.  Download the game and run it trough Python.
